  |   WILL: A Wonderful World is a narrative game with a twist, packed      |
  |   with unique puzzles and an incredible cast.                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   There was an urban legend. Write your troubles down on a note. Hold   |
  |   it in your hand at midnight and pray. "God, please help me..". Then   |
  |   God will hear your plea and change your fate.                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   A young girl wakes up, groggy and in an unknown room. A talking dog   |
  |   appears before her and she becomes startled by his revelation: They   |
  |   are gods and it is their duty to change the fate of any humans that   |
  |   ask for their help. Letters appear in the mail and with pen in hand   |
  |   she begins her job.                                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Dive deep into the story and learn about those that seek out your     |
  |   help but, remember, changing someone's fate will affect others.       |
  |   Experience each story, edit letters and solve puzzles; perhaps the    |
  |   young girl's memory will return, but what will she learn about        |
  |   herself and her mission?                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   WILL: A Wonderful World features a fantastical tale and cast. A       |
  |   quiet nerd stuck in a hopeless, one-sided crush. An impoverished      |
  |   artist who's lost all hope and contemplates suicide. A rookie         |
  |   police officer who burns with justice and hopes for his first big     |
  |   case. A young woman desperately chasing her dream against all odds.   |
  |   Even a stray cat who would be satisfied with some dried fish to       |
  |   eat! You must guide their fates, find the links between the           |
  |   storylines and find the best path for all of those in need.           |
  |                                                                         |
